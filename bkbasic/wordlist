Special notes:
* Executable file size is up to 32256 bytes. 16384 additional bytes maybe used for strings and machine code.  The executable starts from address 512.

* Memory area at 532-569 are free for a user (ML, data). The memory above 16384 is switchable so it has limitations for the direct usage for ML or data.

* Keyboard interrupts are used to provide the key autorepeat.

@ Be carefull with PEEK and POKE -- they ignore the lowest (the oddness) bit.

+ Variable names may have any length.

+ It is possible to use the several statements at one BASIC's line using ':' separator between statements.

* It is necessary to use space(s) between tokens, e.g. 'if a<3 goto 10' requires space between 'if' and 'a' so as between 'goto' and '10'.

* The pages 2, 3, and 6 are used to keep the program and data. Page 0 is used as io-buffer. Page 4 contains AnDOS.  Other pages of memory are free for any usage.

- Supported only integer (at the range -32768..32767) and string (up to 255 char length) types.

- &B number prefix is not supported. &H and &O are supported.

- DIM should be used for any array (even with less than 10 elements) and its number argument has to be a constant.  Only one dimensional arrays are supported.  Only one variable name after DIM is allowed.  The virtual arrays are not supported (so as for VARPTR).

+ New statement GET# allows to use char-by-char data transmission, e.g., GET#a$ inputs one character or the empty string to a$ from a file opened to read.  It is the file equvalent of INKEY$.

* CLEAR requires exactly two arguments but the first argument is ignored because all free memory is available for the strings. CLEAR calls the garbage collector at first.  The second argument sets the upper border of memory for BASIC.  The default value for this border is 49152.  It may be set to 16384 for compatibility with BK0010.

+ New function DEC converts hexadecimal string to the integer, e.g., dec("a0A")=2570.

* INPUT may have a bit different interface. For example, INPUT A,B requires to enter the value for A then press Enter-key and then the value for B terminated by Enter-key.

* CSRLIN and POS completely ignore their arguments.

* FRE shows total about of free memory. The garbage collector is only invoked if the argument type is string. So in the case of the integer or absent argument the shown amount of memory maybe less than the actual.

+ INSTR maybe used with 2 arguments, e.g., instr("abcdef", "cd") = instr(1, "abcdef", "cd").

- Only some syntax errors are detected.

* New function UINT$ provides the conversion to unsigned integer.  For example, UINT$(-1) gives "65535".

+ New function UPPER$ converts lowercase letter in the string to the uppercase.

+ FIND has to use any MS-DOS wildcard pattern.  So FIND "*.TXT" will show all files with TXT-extension, FIND "?." will show files which names consist of one sign and have no extension.  The patterns are case sensitive.

+ FILES command is identical to FIND.

* BLOAD always requires three arguments, e.g. BLOAD "MC",,32768 or BLOAD "MC.BIN",R,47*1024.

* BLOAD and BSAVE can't work with the file bigger than 16 KB.

* USRn(X) call puts X at R5 and then use CALL.  So the return from this ML subroutine may be achieved by RETURN instruction.  The result should be placed at R5.

* SYSTEM and MONIT commands do the same as END.

* \-operator can correctly divide -32768 but it ignores any errors

@ use PEEK(208) and -256 to check the error status after file open. It should be equal to 0 if operation was successful.
