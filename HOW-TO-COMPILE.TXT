This program was developed under Linux using cross-assembler Macro-11 and
several other programs.

The script `compile' builds one bin-file from one asm-file.  It uses `macro11'
and `dumpobj' programs from Macro-11 cross-assembler package
(https://github.com/shattered/macro11).  It also uses the cross-linker
(http://litwr2.atspace.eu/bk11.html).  The usage of awk (gawk-variant) is
optional so as `cat' and `rm' utilities.

The script `f2disk' makes all files required for Xlife-8-BK package and puts
them to a disk image file.  It uses the `compile' script, gcc compiler,
gawk interpreter, and the standard Linux utilities: dd, sudo, mount, umount,
cp, touch, ls, sync, rm.

It is required to write a proper name of the disk image into beginning of
this script, so as the name of mount point for the loop device at your
system.

The only exception is the text editor Notepad+4.  It should be built and moved
independently.
