Partially:
LOCATE

Special notes:

* Supported only integer and string types.

* DIM should be used for any array (even with less than 10 elements) and its number argument has to be a constant.  Only one dimensional arrays are supported.

* New statement GET# allows to use char-by-char data transmission, e.g., GET#a$ inputs one character or the empty string to a$ from a file opened to read.

* INPUT may have a bit different interface.

* CSRLIN and POS completely ignore their arguments.

* FRE - ignores an argument, shows total about of free memory. The garbage collector is only invoked if the argument type is string. So in the case of the integer or absent argument the shown amount of memory maybe less than the actual.

* Only some syntax errors are detected.

* New function UINT$ provides the conversion to unsigned integer.  For example, UINT$(-1) gives "65535".
